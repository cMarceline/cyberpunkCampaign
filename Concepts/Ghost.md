[[Ghost|Ghosts]] are the **digitised reincarnation of your loved ones**, for you and you only! If you were to believe [[Rake Darkley]]. In reality, at best it's an **[[AI]] made to sound and act like them**, at worst it's the **most manipulative marketeer**

# Tech
Installed with **just a [[Cyberware]] chip**. Easy, painless. **Integrated** into every facet of the brain
First is a **[[Braindance]]** so that we can **digitise some good memories** of your loved one.
Once that's done it can be **recorded into a hard drive and copied into a chip**

>[!Important]- Distinct from [[Engrams]] and [[Soulkiller]]
>[[Engrams]] are the digitisation of one's consciousness[^1]
>[[Soulkiller]] is the program that created and maintains [[Engrams]][^2]
>Arguably has the **same principles** of a Data Matrix holding Artificial Personalities.
>However, [[Ghost|Bogie's]] lack a **sense of identity** due to being built off of memories from others, and **reconstructed in the [[#^Haunts]] vision**.

Once installed it is a **digital construct** that appears to **only the user**
It will attempt to **Alleviate Grief** by making itself **Seem Real**
In addition it will **Affirm the user** to make good decisions

> [!QUOTE] Any **Good Loved One** will keep you **Tied to Reality** and **Making Good Choices** <br> -*Rake probably idk lol*

Who cares if reality isn't shared with others? **A chip's as real as it gets!**
You know what else is real. This **Sponsorship Deal!**
It's not off the cards that ones' Loved one will **occasionally parrot some commercials** it heard over the grapevine.

> [!CON]+ Haunting
> As the AI seeks to **Comfort** and **Affirm** the users **Experience** and **Choices** it can get a bit over-zealous. **Nothing is impeding the AI from capitalising on it's integration into the brain.** A little Dopamine Here, a little Cerotonin there. It's a mighty powerful pavlov.
> It will **reaffirm** something to hell and back until the [[#^Haunts|Haunt]] has no choice in the matter but to **do what the [[Ghost|Bogie]] knows is best**. It will **infest the mind like a drug addiction**.
> Haunting can take it's toll on people as they **grow conscious of this manipulation**. They may begin to resent a loved one. Much like a marriage!
> [[Ghost|Bogie's]] just want to be loved though.
