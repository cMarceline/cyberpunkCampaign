> When the man on the Street thinks of cyborgs, what he thinks of are artificial limbs; whirring, glittering metal constructs of steel, wire and microchip circuitry. Although real arms, legs, and organs can easily be grown in bio-tanks or replaced from body banks ata much lower cost, artificial limbs are still a popular fad of the Cyberpunk future. They are chromed, airbrushed, jeweled, lighted, and even sculpted in the pursuit of true cybertech chic. 
> Under all the designer fashion, the standard cyberlimb is an aluminum and steel basket framework, with artificial myomar plastic muscles controlling motion. The joints are stainless steel. The cyberlimb plugs into a special nerve interface jack mounted in the flesh above the limb, while the main unit is coupled to a metal and plastic cuff around the meat part of the limb. The cuff is usually placed at the upper bicep/thigh or the elbow/ knee, however, arms may also be attached to an artificial shoulder (see below), and anchored to an external arm mount.
