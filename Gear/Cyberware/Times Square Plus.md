> NEW from ZETATECH! Just recently declassified the new TimesSquare Plus cyberoptics upgrade integrates your cybereye with a cognitive-reflex processor and a DataTerm link or chipware plugs. Special chipware allows visual recognition, identification, and information retrieval. Full integration with the Farley File database allows you to access needed information easily and quickly, displaying the records on your Times Square Plus marquee. This upgrade can also be used with the new Video Imager cybereye. (See the Chipware Section, pg.76 of this catalog for further information.) Takes 3 options. HC=2. Half price if done as an upgrade
