> Also known as viral transformation, this enhancement involves two types of nanoids. The first type threads synthetic muscle through the natural muscle fibers, anchoring and strengthening them. The second type wraps the bones in a light weave of metal and plastic threads, making them stronger and thicker. The result is an increase of +2 to the character's Body Type stat. This increase is both in strength and the ability to absorb physical damage. This enhancement is virtually indetectable and takes about two weeks (Body Type increases by 1 each week).
