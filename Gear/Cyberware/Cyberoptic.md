> A combination of digital processor and camera, cyberoptics are replacements for normal eyes. Cybervision is just like regular vision, only better. Colors are brighter, images sharper. And that’s just the start. 
> Want to see life as a 30's black and white movie? No problem. Telescopic or microscopic vision? Optional. Infrared and low light vision? Standard for Solos. 
> Cyberoptics can look exactly like normal eyes, although a wide variety of fashion iris colors are available (amber, white, burgundy and violet are very popular). Some versions are transparent, with glitter or lights swirling inside of them. Other are superchromed for a more “cyber” look. Others can change eye color at will or to match clothes and surroundings. Some even have tiny designer logos around the iris. Cyberoptics with cameras or weapons usually load from the front, with the iris opening up when the front of the eye is depressed.
