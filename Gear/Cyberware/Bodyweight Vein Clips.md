> The greatest danger to any downed 'Punk on the street is dying before medical aid (even Trauma Team) can arrive to save you. What does many people in is sudden shock brought on by massive blood loss. Bodyweight has been very successful in remedying this situation by placing clips on major veins and arteries that can reduce or stop bloodflow when required. Specialized sensors monitor pulse and blood pressure, expanding and contracting the clips as necessary
