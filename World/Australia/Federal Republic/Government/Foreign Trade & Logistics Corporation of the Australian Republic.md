[[Foreign Trade & Logistics Corporation of the Australian Republic]], abbreviated as [[Foreign Trade & Logistics Corporation of the Australian Republic|FTLCA]], and colloquially referred to as [[Foreign Trade & Logistics Corporation of the Australian Republic|The Line]] is the [State Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_monopoly) that focuses on the control of imports and exports to direct Australian money into it's domestic business.
# Goals
[[Foreign Trade & Logistics Corporation of the Australian Republic|FTLCA]] aims to unify the goals of a strong government with it's economy. It does so by binding it's Imports, Exports, and Domestic Business directly with a National Corporation. This state monopoly will then be able to take the role that many [[Multinational Corporations]] would take without becoming a direct competitor by providing Australians with National Backed local businesses with the hard power of the [[Multinational Corporations]].
# Failure
The [[Foreign Trade & Logistics Corporation of the Australian Republic|FTLCA]] remains unsuccessful as the pace of the domestic businesses cannot match the scale at which multinational corporations are able to operate. As it raced in order to meet the demands of the Australian people, reality began to show itself, and the [[Foreign Trade & Logistics Corporation of the Australian Republic|FTLCA]] took to a policy of control. It began to take control of it's ports, and worked more closely with the [[Cape York Port]] to heavily monitor import and export. It then began to heavily tax [[Multinational Corporations]] such as [[Arasaka]], in an attempt to encourage the Australian people to interface with local businesses. Unfortunately it failed to consider that local businesses were not just outpaced, but incapable of meeting the demands, and as foreign interest began to dry out with it's taxation policies, the [[Federal Republic|FRA]] delved deeper into poverty.
# Restructuring
With the [[Federal Republic|FRA]] being delved into poverty, the obvious failure of [[Foreign Trade & Logistics Corporation of the Australian Republic|FTLCA]], and the election of the [[Liberal Party]], it underwent a restructuring, where instead of being a framework for Domestic Business to prosper, it became an interface for [[Multinational Corporations]]. Existing [[Foreign Trade & Logistics Corporation of the Australian Republic|FTLCA]] were able to retain a degree of separation between the National Monopoly and [[Federal Republic|FRA]] Government to keep it safe from corruption. Because that's the [[Liberal Party|Libs]] favourite 

Domestic Business was now sent to interface with the [[Australian Domestic Business Guiding Commission]] that retained a joint ownership between the [[Federal Republic|FRA]] and the [[Foreign Trade & Logistics Corporation of the Australian Republic|FTLCA]]. 
# Real Life Analogues
[[Foreign Trade & Logistics Corporation of the Australian Republic|FTLCA]] is attempting to mimic the success of the [Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_International_Trade_and_Industry). Where the [MITI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_International_Trade_and_Industry) was able to set up a successful industrial base within Japan coming out of WWII. It was able to do so by
