[[Australia]] is currently a world at much civil unrest. Despite all the makings of a prosperous nation, many hands are placed into [[Australia]] trying to harvest that power for itself. Primarily [[Australia]] the continent has been split into two separate countries [[Federal Republic|The Federal Republic of Australia]] and [[West Australia|The West Australia Republic]]

# West Australia
[[West Australia]] is a largely conservative sector that [[Succession of West Australia|succeeded]] from [[Federal Republic|The Federal Republic of Australia]], over conflicts of [[Aboriginal Land]] ownership and ties to the [[British Monarchy]]. It quickly became the more prosperous sector of the nation by making swift deals with large [[Corporations]] and in particular [[Arasaka]].

# Federal Republic of Australia
[[Federal Republic|The Federal Republic of Australia]] attempted to remain a strong political power within the global economy by sustaining strong domestic business. The [[Federal Republic|FRA]] set up a national monopoly, colloquially known as [[Foreign Trade & Logistics Corporation of the Australian Republic|The Line]], on import and export of it's rare earth minerals, while imposing heavy tax on the import of goods from [[Multinational Corporations]]. While this successfully fended off the larger issues of corruption that many of the other prosperous nations were facing, it heavily neutered the prosperity of the [[Federal Republic|FRA]]. In addition this led to the [[Federal Republic|FRA]] being rapid in it's response to domestic political strife, but impossibly slow for international relations.
