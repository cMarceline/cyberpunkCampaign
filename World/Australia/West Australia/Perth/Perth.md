# Geography
[[Perth Toner.png]]

Perth occupies a very unique niche in [[Australia]] as a **major [[Corporations|Corporate Hub]]**, and being **completely remote** from the rest of the world. If you've got the cash, there are **sparse flights**, but the main way in is through the [[Swan River]], with most unloading straight into the [[Red District]].

> [!Warning] Out of reach of the rest of the world, Perth ends up **out of mind to many**. Making it prime for the **corps to do as they see fit**. Rules of international law often are left behind.
