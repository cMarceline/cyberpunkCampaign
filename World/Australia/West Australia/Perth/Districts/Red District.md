The main Perth City ends up a **sprawling climb up the Corporate Ladder**, as the most prime real estate has a view of the sun. Much **like a rain forest**, the [[Corporations]] would grow up when one didn't feel respected enough, leaving much of the **world underneath in the dark**. The sun blocked by a **tangle of highways, a building offshoot, and a false floor** all suspended by the Skyscraper standing nearest. Thank [[Arasaka]] for the [[Artificial Sun]].
